This is my personal site.

It has two primary purposes:

1. A playground for me to make fun things.
2. A place for folks to see some employment type info that doesn't really have a place on linkedin.

Please do:
1. Check out the site, let me know what you like and what you don't
2. Check out the code, let me know what sucks.

Please do not:
1. Assume I think the code is perfect and maintainable. This is a solo project with many efforts being done within a day or so. Code quality / browser compaditibiliy / performance only matter so much here.

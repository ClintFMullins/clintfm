This is my personal site, hosted here: https://www.clint.fm

It has two primary purposes:

1. A playground for me to make fun things.
2. A place for folks to see some employment type info that doesn't really have a place on linkedin.

Please note: the code quality / project setup is generally not great. This is a playground, not a museum :)
